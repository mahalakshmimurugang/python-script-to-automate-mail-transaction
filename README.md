Hey all!
This python script is focussed to transfer mail to multiple recipients with multiple attachments simultaneously without major time delay.
Suffient commands are provided for your understanding. 

Features:
->The sent files are moved to a seperate sub-folder under 'sent-files' folder with timestamp.
->To keep a note on the process, an 'Error_logs' txt file is created to keep track on the script whenever it runs.
->Another 'Email_date.txt' is created to keep a note of the date(when first run) and as days passby, when the days difference is > 30, the previous contents are removed from the 'error_logs.txt'. Thereby, updating the date file with the new date.
->Simple and understandable

Happy coding!
